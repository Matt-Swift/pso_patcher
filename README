What is Sylverant PSO Patcher?
------------------------------
Sylverant PSO Patcher is a program designed to be used as a boot-disc for the
Sega Dreamcast to patch various aspects of the game Phantasy Star Online. The
individual items patched depend on the version of the game, which is detected
automatically at run-time. This patching program offers the ability to have
PSO auto-connect to a private server (specifically the Sylverant Private
Server hosted at sylverant.net), fix the missing ultimate maps in v2, and to
re-enable use of the versions of the game that have been hampered by the
Hunter's License check.

While the first and third patches (the private server connection and disabling
the Hunter's License check) could be done with a cheat device, such as the
Codebreaker/Xploder, many people are opposed to their use, even for legitimate
purposes that do not involve cheating. Sylverant PSO Patcher gives those
opposed to using cheating devices another option to connect with. Also, within
our research in putting together this program, we could not find a way to get
the second patch (the Ultimate mode map fix) to work with Codebreaker/Xploder
at all!

This program is the result of a bunch of research done by myself and Aleron
Ives. Aleron Ives is the one that came up with the Ultimate mode map fix (both
on PSOPC and on the Dreamcast versions). I was the one that worked out how to
fix the Hunter's License check issue. In addition, Lee provided Ives (and thus
myself as well) with some data that was needed to complete the project. Many
thanks go out to both Aleron Ives and Lee for their part in getting this project
off the ground!


What has changed in v1.1?
-------------------------
In a nutshell, v1.0 was very buggy. In fact, I'm somewhat surprised that we
didn't see the bugs in testing it initially. For that, I apologize. Version 1.1
fixes the following bugs:

1. PSO shows only a black screen when connected via a VGA box.
2. Various in-game bugs are exhibited, such as being able to walk through the
   pillar in the Hunter's Guild and techniques not targeting properly.

The first bug, I'd consider somewhat minor. The second one though is plain bad.
They're both fixed in v1.1 though.


What versions of PSO does Sylverant PSO Patcher work with?
----------------------------------------------------------
Sylverant PSO Patcher works with the following versions of PSO (for Dreamcast):

    - Phantasy Star Online - Japanese
    - Phantasy Star Online - US
    - Phantasy Star Online - European/PAL
    - Phantasy Star Online Ver.2 - Japanese
    - Phantasy Star Online Ver.2 - US
    - Phantasy Star Online Ver.2 - European/PAL

That should be all versions released for the Dreamcast, with the exception of
any trial/beta/etc versions. If you find a version of the game that it does
not work with, please let me know! Every once in a while, it may report an
issue reading one of these game discs. Most likely, this means that either your
disc is dirty/scratched or the GD-ROM laser in your Dreamcast is weak and
cannot read the disc properly.

Also, please note that this program intentionally only works with GD-ROM
copies of the game. It will not work with any versions burned onto a CD-R, and
I will never release a version that works with CD-R copies of the game. Doing
so, in my eyes, would encourage piracy, which is not something I want to do.


How do I use Sylverant PSO Patcher?
-----------------------------------
Most people will probably want to use Sylverant PSO Patcher as a boot-disc for
their copy of PSO. To do so, just burn Sylverant PSO Patcher as you would any
other homebrew program for the Dreamcast. The 1ST_READ.BIN file that is
included with the binary release is pre-scrambled.

How you go about burning the disc is completely up to you. I personally still
follow Marcus' old guide at http://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html and burn from the
command line on my Mac or on Linux. On Windows, you may find BootDreams to be
useful in burning the program.

It is also possible to use dcload-ip or dcload-serial to upload the binary to
your Dreamcast and run it. If you want to do that, I suggest taking the binary
release and descrambling the 1ST_READ.BIN and uploading that. You should use
dcload's "-n" switch, as Sylverant PSO Patcher overwrites dcload's memory space
on the Dreamcast shortly after starting. Without the -n switch, dcload will get
very confused and probably prevent the program from working at all.

Once the patcher starts, you should swap in a GD-ROM disc. From there, follow
the prompts on the screen (it should tell you what version of the game you put
in the drive, and ask you to press start to boot the game). If it displays a
message saying that it doesn't recognize the disc, you may want to reboot your
Dreamcast, and check your PSO disc and the laser of your Dreamcast, then try
again.

Note, this program can be used essentially as an import boot disc for the
Dreamcast as well. In this case, if you're putting in a game other than PSO, you
can safely ignore the warning that it doesn't recognize the game. As long as the
game is pretty normal, it should "just work".


Special Thanks!
---------------
Special thanks go out to the following people who have in some way influenced
this program:

    - Aleron Ives - For pushing me to do this in the first place, for the
                    Ultimate mode map fix, and for providing me with some data
                    that was needed to finish the program. Also, for testing out
                    a few initial versions of the program before I released it.
    - Lee - For providing data to Aleron Ives that I needed for finishing the
            program.
    - Schthack - For making the first private server for PSO. Without Schthack's
                 private server, PSO would probably be long gone by now.
    - Jean-Paul Van Gorder - For providing the background used in the program.
